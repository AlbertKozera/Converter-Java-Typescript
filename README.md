# Converter Java <-> TypeScript

This project involves the design and implementation of an application that enables the conversion of classes from Java DTO to TypeScript classes and vice versa. The application also supports multithreading to speed up the conversion of a large number of files. Additionally, it incorporates multiple programming paradigms.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to create a tool that can:
- Convert Java DTO classes to TypeScript classes.
- Convert TypeScript classes back to Java DTO classes.
- Utilize multithreading to optimize the performance for large-scale file conversions.
- Apply different programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, and declarative) throughout the implementation.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java 8
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
- **GUI Framework**: JavaFX
- **Testing Frameworks**: JUnit, Mockito
- **Build Tool**: Apache Maven

## Key Features

- **Multithreaded File Conversion**: Speeds up the conversion process when handling a large number of files.
- **Programming Paradigms**:
  - **Declarative Programming**: Used for describing the GUI layout in FXML files.
  - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes and objects like `UserConfiguration` are used to model real-world entities.
  - **Functional Programming**: Leveraged through Java Streams, lambda expressions, and related constructs.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents uploading of empty files.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Provides detailed logging of application events and actions in the console.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of multiple programming paradigms in a Java-based application, effectively utilizing object-oriented, functional, and declarative styles to achieve its objectives. Additionally, the use of multithreading enhances performance for file conversions, making the application efficient and robust.
